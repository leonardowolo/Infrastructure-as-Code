# IaC Challenge (Team 3)
The Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Challenge is a school assignment for the subject Emerging Technologies.

## What did this assignment contain?
We had to automate infrastructure provisioning and application deployment using continuous integration and continuous delivery or continuous deployment (ci/cd).

### What does our environment look like?
Since we are students, we had the opportunity to use [Azure for Students](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/free/students/). So that was already an hurdle we didn't have to look at.  

Our environment consists of 2 virtual machines (vm's), the "management" vm that Jenkins runs on. This vm is also going to be used to provision and configure our 2nd vm.

### Tools used
* Ansible / Teraform (Hashicorp)
* Jenkins
* mySQL
* PHP

#### Our Team
Robbe Meulemans, Bob Lourdaux, Yari Van Doninck, Leonardo Wolo
